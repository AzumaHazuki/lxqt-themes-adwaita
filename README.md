# lxqt-themes-adwaita

This repository houses the Adwaita and Adwaita-Dark themes for LXQt, along with their associated palettes and a pair of purpose-crafted Openbox themes. Credit for the .xbm files in the Openbox themes goes to <a href=https://www.box-look.org/p/1226549/>WarleySouza</a> on box-look.org, though the rest of the themes are entirely original creations. Adwaita and its appearance are of course copyright the Gnome/GTK developers.

While LXQt does not explicitly depend on Openbox, most distros ship it by default and the vast majority of LXQt desktops on X11/Xorg will be running it. Therefore, it is recommended to download and install the Openbox themes to ~/.themes (or /usr/share/themes if root and you want all users to have access) as this provides the most complete possible look.
